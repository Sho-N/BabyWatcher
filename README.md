# Introduction
## Story
I have three children. The yongest child is still a baby, but I don't have time to take care of her when I'm busy with elder siblings. In fact, for newborn babies, even just turning over and lying on their stomachs can be life-threatening due to suffocation. Therefore, it is very important to keep an eye on your baby to make sure he or she doesn't stay prone all the time.

## About my project
I have created an application that monitors wheter the baby stays prone or supine on my behalf. This will make every day safe for the baby.
